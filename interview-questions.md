# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Repeating an action for a specified number of times until a condition is met.

  Researched answer:
  Executing a code block for a specified number of times until a condition is met. Iteration can be used on strings and arrays because they have a length property. A popular example of iteration is the for loop. For a loop to properly occur the code must specify the starting location (index), the condition that must be met before it can stop the iterations, and the action that must be performed after each loop (example: multiply by 3).


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: Value, index, and array are the predefined parameters. Value is required.

  Researched answer:
  Value, index, and array are the predefined parameters. Value is the only pre-defined parameter that is required. The value parameter let's you change each item in the original array and return the updated item into a new array of the same length.


3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Using the value associated with a key in an object.

  Researched answer:
  Allows you to unpack multiple values at a time from arrays or objects into variables.


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is reusable code.

  Researched answer:
  A function and a method are both a piece of code that is called by name. Functions are self contained and are called independently. Values can be passed to a function (through its parameters) and the output is a value. A method, however, is assigned to an object and is used to manipulate an instance of a class. A method is called using the object of that class.


5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
  Objects are a collection of keys and their associated values. Classes are blueprints of objects.

  Researched answer:
  Classes are blueprints of objects that make the objects reusable, and define an executable block of code. An object belongs to a class and are a collection of key  value pairs.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  I don't have any kind of good guess on this. It may mean to prioritize the order of functions for a particular purpose

  Researched answer:
  Variables and functions (not function expressions) are 'hoisted' to the top of the code block but they aren't used until declared. All undeclared variables are essentially global variables. Declaring all variables and functions at the beginning is a good way for developers to avoid errors and getting a surprise when they attempt to re-use variable and function names between inner and outer scope.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class.

2. React: React is used for creating the view for web and mobile apps.

3. React state: Where you store property values that belong to a component. It can contain as many properties as you need. You can change the value in the state object and it will update the component.

4. React lifecycle methods: Each component in React has a lifecycle that you monitor and make change as needed. There are four built in methods 1.constructor 2. getDerivedStateFromProps() 3.render() 4.componentDidMount()

5. DOM: DOM stands for Document Object Model. The browser crates a DOM of the page when a web page is loaded. It is a W3C World Wide Web Consortium standard for accessing documents.
